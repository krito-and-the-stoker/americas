Trade with natives is started by building [[Trade Buildings]] in your colony.
## Natives trade values
wood, ore - 0
food - 2
sugar, cotton, tobacco, fur - 3
tools, beads - 15
rum, cloth, coats, cigars - 15
guns, horses, silver - 20

Natives will use these values as baseline for their trade offers, depending on what they have and what they need. Natives do not produce a big surplus, except for furs, and will not trade away stuff they need.
