## School

1 teacher:
- Teaching his profession and increasing literacy
- Requires a low class [Profession] or none
## Collage

1 teacher
- Teaching his profession and increasing literacy
- Requires a medium class [[Professions]]
## University
### Jobs
1 teacher

Although they theoretically are levels of an education building, a collage should not replace a school and a university should replace neither, instead a second level school makes the school bigger allowing for more teachers, etc


## Library

Slowly increases literacy for every colonist in the colony
