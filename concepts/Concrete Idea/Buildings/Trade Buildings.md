## Trade post
You can set one (ore more) goods you need, which will trigger nearby settlements to send a trader with that good. Once the native trader reaches your colony, negotiations are made in a popup and which result in a one time purchase or a trade route. Natives are not interested in money, instead they engage only in trade for other goods, that must be available in the colony.
