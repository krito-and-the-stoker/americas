### Motivation
In the current version, immigration is done purely with crosses. This is understandable, but the story this tells is very one-sided. Instead, we would like to present different motives for immigration, that also lead to different migrants. Some conceptual work has to be done to complete immigration.
### Self managed
These are the default immigrants, they cannot be too poor, because the travel to the new world  is expensive. So they would usually be some second sons of land owners or small lords that would not inherit much and seek an opportunity to build a new life. Naturally, people that now about shipping are more likely to go, so among those we expect to see:
- Fishermen
- Farmers
- Traders
- Settlers (no [[Professions]])
We will still need to find a system to model their immigration. The immigration speed can be increased by an option to promise land for every new immigrant. When promising land, unworked land in your colonies generates this type of immigration (and possibly others).
### Indentured Servants
These immigrants cannot pay for the travel to come, so they find somebody to pay and are indebted, which means they need to work off their debt before they can live a free life. They will be usually unskilled and all will start with the [[Colonist States]] indebted.
We need to think about what will trigger these kinds of immigration, could be vey similar to self-managed.
### Petty criminals
This relates to the Transport System of the English authorities, which sent convicted criminals, if their crime was not too severe, onto a transport ship and put them into forced labour for several (7-14) years. After that time, they became free citizen. They will have the same [[Colonist States]] indebted, which will last a bit longer. Also, because these are usually poor and uneducated, their literacy will be lower than normal.
### Religious Freedom
Caused by religious turmoil in Europe, many people fled persecution to the Americas. This is especially true for the Calvinist and Puritans in general in England after King Henry VIII proclaimed himself the head of his newly founded church in 1534. This can maybe said for protestants in the Netherlands fighting the 80 years independence war against Spain. Portraying the new world as a save haven for a new society will be done by producing crosses (a [[Virtual Goods]]). These types of immigrants have a slightly higher [[Literacy]].
### Conquer
This kind of immigration is more suited to the Spanish situation after the Reconquista has completed. Conquerers will be attracted by mostly by loot, but also by militaristic infrastructure present in the new world. The story of Cortez has inspired many to seek wealth by conquering natives. Immigrants of this kind are attracted by Silver sold in the home port and guns being available in the new world.
