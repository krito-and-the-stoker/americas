## trade post (small, big)
- you can set one (ore more) goods you need, which will trigger nearby settlements to send a trader with that good. negotiations are made in a popup and may result in a trade route. natives will want resources from that colony, they don't care for money
- more levels can support more trade routes and has larger attraction range
## contor, custom house
- like trade post, but for other European ships, that will appear.
- level 1 import only, level 2 also export
## dock, loading bay, commercial harbour
   - influences the time of loading/unloading of ships
   - without a dock, the ships crew manages loading without infrastructure. this will be slow and only 1 ship at a time
   - a dock without worker provides 1 extra loading space (2x for 1 ship)
   - a dock provides 1 space and one job for a worker (5x for 1 ship)
   - loading bay provides 3 jobs (10x per ship, 1 ship per worker)
   - commercial harbour provides 3 jobs (25x per ship, 2 ship per worker)
