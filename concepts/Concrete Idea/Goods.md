## Potential new goods:
- rename trade goods -> beads (good idea)
- stone (for high prestige buildings, church, fortress) (good idea)
- coffee (cash crop) (good idea, introduce later with an event)
- cows (could be an alternative food source) (good idea, more thoughts needed)
- tea, porcelain (import only goods) (why not)
- sulfur (tools + sulfur -> guns) (not high priority for me)
- dye (made from trees in Brazil) (probably not necessary)
- salt (for meat and fish conservation, probably not necessary)
