#old-world #laws-and-ownership

This is a middle ground between a "borrow money" button and kind of a mission that gives the player a few ideas of what to do. The types of ventures could be:
## Found a new Colony:
- Large sum, long runtime, 1 settler, 1 pioneer, 1 soldier, small ship
- Must found a colony with the promised name
- Cost: all goods sold in Europe will have a percentage cut for the investors. The percentage will be the percentage of people living in that colony compared to the whole colonial empire
- The investors will have a say and block some decisions:
  - Growth focus: Cannot remove colonists below threshhold
  - Economical focus: Once a fur trader, weaver (etc) is working, he cannot be removed
  - Bonuses: Certain buildings cheaper, plantations cheaper, free colonial office 
  - There will be a possibility to buy out those investors later
  - If the colony goes poorly, investors may fold, player will not get punished
## Conquer a native tribe for the spoils
- Medium sum, 3 soldiers, a scout and a cannon, all without upkeep cost
- Short time investment
- Cost: For the duration of the conquest, all spoils of war halfed
- Investors will not allow to skip the conquest
- Conquest is over once peace is made
- Investors will not allow peace if there was too little effort
- If the conquest goes poorly, investors may double down and offer reinforcements
## Build pirate base
- Medium sum, 3 Soldiers, 2 ships
- Medium term investements
- Cost: Goods sold in Europe have a cut for the investors
- Military buildings cheaper
- Can send ships with valuable goods to Europe to buy out investors
## Build tobacco industry
- Small sum, 2 settlers, 1 pioneers, 1 master cigar maker
- Medium time investment
- Cost: Tobacco and cigars sold in Europe have a percentage cut for the investors
- Bonuses for tobacco industry (buildings & plantations cheaper)
- There will be a chance to buy out the investors
## Ask the church for help
- Medium sum, 3 jesuit missionaries, 1 master priest, 1 soldier
- Long term partnership
- Cost: no direct cost invovled, but the church may ask for certain things
- church buildings are cheaper, cross production bonus
- There is a way to buy out from the church for a large sum
- The church may request you to build churches, schools and construct missions.

The investors as described here should be kind of both: They help you at the start, but later you would like to get rid of them. The production of liberty bells could be somehow part of the political struggle to get rid of those investors. Maybe the bell production triggers the progress for buyout possibilities. In that sense, the play with the investors are a precursor to the revolution against the king.
