The loading and unloading of ships costs time. This is not true for the player, because he is the governor and very important, and also the gaming experience would be terrible. Automated trade though takes some time. This time is dependent on the infrastructure of the colony:

Without a dock, the ships crew manages loading without infrastructure. This will be slow and only 1 ship at a time can be loaded or unloaded. All other ships in harbour will have to wait for a free loading slot. Docks, Loading bay and Commercial harbour [[Infrastructure Buildings]] will speed things up and add more slots for parallel loading.

This long delay does not occur with wagon trains, as they are easier to load / unload.
