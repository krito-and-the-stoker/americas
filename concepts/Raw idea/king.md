King

The king looks at you like an investment. He is a little bit like an investor, but without any benefits for you.

- Relatively quick he will invent a tax for all goods you sell in Europe at 3%
- He may ask you for one time payments to support one of his wars
- If you are trading with other Europeans, he may ask you to stop or raise taxes
- He may raise your taxes
- He may send an exploration ship for the surrounding of America and ask for your support in a harbour. You will be granted vision of all new explorations from that ship.
- He may ask you to defend your colonies against another aggressor: He will give you some troops, and some time later, a hostile fleet will arrive at the colonies and you must defend. Even if you fail, you will get back the colonies in the peace treaty afterwards.
- He may send you some troops and ask you to attack another colony or a native tribe
- If he is unhappy with your rule, he may send a lord and grant him one of your colonies. You then are tasked to take it back by force.
- He will eventually send his expedition force and fight the war for independence against you
