#colonies
Potential new resources:
- beads (trade goods)
- salpeter (3 tools + 1 salpeter -> 2 guns)
- stone (for high prestige buildings, church, fortress)
- salt (for meat and fish conservation, maybe not needed)
- coffee (another cash crop to sell)
- dye (made from trees in Brazil)
- tea, porcelain, spices (import only goods)

we could diversify horses into:
- work animals (horses, donkeys)
- farm animals (pigs, cows)
probably enough to rename horses into animals


Change the role of some resources:
We want to tell the story, that tools, guns and horses (or animals in general) make a huge technological difference for the settlers. early settlements rely on their availablility and often fail when they run out of stock.
- tools will increase the efficiency of farming, mining, fishing, woodcutting
- guns will increase the efficiency of hunting
- horses/animals will increase the efficiency of farming, mining, hunting and woodcutting
- guns will arm the colonies militia, giving a significant edge in fights against natives
The usage of tools, guns and horses in normal production should not be high, but constant. They will remind the dependency on the motherland and the home market before an industry for tools and guns has been built in the new world. Once, a colony is out of these goods, the production bonuses they yield will vanish, hurting the economy severely.

The initial production of food and other crops will be very bad (yield about 2), so that careful planning of resources is necessary in the beginning. once the earth has been plowed, buildings are built, experts have entered the game, the production will be quite good.

Because every resource is needed to progress further in the game, the restriction on what resource can be grown where will be a lot more lose: currently, we have fields for food, cotton, tobacco and sugar (sorted from cold to warm)
- Food fields will produce a little cotton and a tiny tobacco, very good food
- Cotton fields will produce a tiny tobacco and a tiny sugar, okay food
- tobacco fields will produce a tiny cotton and a little sugar, okay food
- sugar fields will produce a little tobacco and a tiny cotton, good food
tiny means 1 per field when plowed, no bonuses. little means 1 per field, bonuses halfed. regular is 2 per field full bonuses.
That means, if you are starting out with your first master farmer, but you are in a sugar region, it is possible to get some cotton very inefficiently until you have a proper cotton infrastructure up to scale
