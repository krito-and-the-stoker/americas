When a colonist is missing wood

When a colonist is missing food
- will get a production malus, except for food
- may trigger events:
 -> Raid food from natives
 		may get food, upset natives, higher chance with guns
 -> Steal food from stock
 		only when stock is high and multiple colonists suffer, will destroy some food
 -> Leave colony to join natives
 		higher chance when relations with natives are good, may come back after some time
