These are the physical goods. We also have [[Virtual Goods]]
## Current goods
- Food: Basic need, every colonist and most units require 2 food per [[Production Cycle]]
- Sugar: Cash crop, can be made into rum
- Tobacco: Cash crop, can be made into cigars
- Cotton: Cash crop, can be made into cloths
- Furs: Cash crop, can be made into coats
- Wood: Construction good, all buildings need it, also every colonist needs 1 wood per [[Production Cycle]]
- Ore: Raw good that can be made into tools
- Silver: Very high priced good in Europe
- Horses: Needs redo, currently only used by scouts and dragoons
- Rum: Expensive trade and luxury good
- Cigars: Expensive trade and luxury good
- Cloths: Expensive trade and luxury good, needed by ships
- Coats: Expensive trade and luxury good
- Trade Goods: Needs a bit rethinking, is in the game but pretty much unused
- Tools: Very useful, important for construction and pioneering
- Guns: Used by colonists in a colony to defend themselves, equip soldiers

## Potential new goods:
- rename trade goods -> beads (good idea)
- stone (for high prestige buildings, church, fortress) (good idea)
- coffee (cash crop) (good idea, introduce later with an event)
- livestock (could be an alternative food source) (good idea, more thoughts needed)
- tea, porcelain (import only goods) (why not)
- sulfur (tools + sulfur -> guns) (not high priority for me)
- dye (made from trees in Brazil) (probably not necessary)
- salt (for meat and fish conservation, probably not necessary)

## Idea
We want to tell the story, that tools, guns and horses (or animals in general) make a huge technological difference for the settlers. early settlements rely on their availablility and often fail when they run out of stock.
- tools will increase the efficiency of farming, mining, fishing, woodcutting
- guns will increase the efficiency of hunting
- horses/livestock will increase the efficiency of farming, mining, hunting and woodcutting
- guns will arm the colonies militia, giving a significant edge in fights against natives
The usage of tools, guns and horses in normal production should not be high, but constant. They will remind the dependency on the motherland and the home market before an industry for tools and guns has been built in the new world. Once, a colony is out of these goods, the production bonuses they yield will vanish, hurting the economy severely.

At this point it is not clear how we would make this into a concrete concept.
