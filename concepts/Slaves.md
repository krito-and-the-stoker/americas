Slaves are such an important factor in the building of the north american colonies, that we cannot ignore them.
### Acquiring Slaves
- They cannot directly be bought int he home port
- Instead, they will be offered at the international trade ports in the colonies
- They can be forced from the natives
- They can be bought from natives for goods or military alliance
### Legal situation
Slavery has to be subject to some laws depending on the country:
- Spanish colonies allow slavery of non-christians. This will change for natives in 1542 which makes enslaving natives illegal (harder) and shifts to African slaves instead.
- Portugese (?)
- English colonies did not allow slavery per se. They had the indentured servant system, which allowed slave-like contracts for a limited time. Those could be extended to imported slaves. In 1661 slavery is officially allowed.
- French colonies did not allow enslaving people, but possession was okay. This led to acquiring slaves through trade or militay alliances with the neighboring natives, which already had a practice of enslavement. In 1709 slavery becomes legal, leading to a boom in slave trade.
Even before it is legal, slaves will be offered at the ports, but it is not possible yet to establish trade routes.
### Jobs
Slaves can only work certain jobs:
farming (food, tobacco, cotton, sugar), mining (silver, ore), lumberjack
They can not become hunter, fisher or work in the manufacturing industry
### Control
Because slaves have a tendency to revolt or flee, there is a control value for them. With more slaves control will decrease. Military presence and buildings like the slave quarters, stockade, militia quarters will increase control.
