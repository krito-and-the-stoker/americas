Deseases:
- Settlers can fall ill: severe production malus
- When fallen ill, after some time a settler will either die or recover
 -> The living standard of the settler influences the chance of recovery
 -> After recovery, the settler is more immune to the deseases
- Health benefits for:
 -> housing
 -> doctors / hospitals
 -> Power value
- high population density increase chance of desease
- work type has effect on desease
- Terrain dependent: More hot or wet areas are more prone to deseases
- Chance of getting ill depends on the heritage and region:
 -> Natives often fall ill when in contact with Europeans
 -> Europeans have trouble with hot weather (Carribean, Mexico, Florida)
 -> Africans have trouble with cold weather (Canada)
