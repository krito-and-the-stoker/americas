When a colonist is missing luxury supplies:
- colonist loses production bonus temporarily
- colonist is unhappy and will be hindering immigration
When a colonist is missing wood
- will get a production malus, bonus for wood
- increased chance of illness
- may trigger events:
 -> Tear down building
When a colonist is missing food
- will get a production malus, except for food
- may trigger events:
 -> Raid food from natives
 		may get food, upset natives, higher chance with guns
 -> Steal food from stock
 		only when stock is high and multiple colonists suffer, will destroy some food
 -> Leave colony to join natives
 		higher chance when relations with natives are good, may come back after some time
 -> Leave colony for Europe
 		higher chance with international trading port, more likely for high power colonists
 -> Die from starvation
    more likely for low power colonists

Whenever a colonists dies or leaves, it has an adverse effect on immigration, spreading the news of the colony's hardship.

Because food is so critical to the survival of colonists, they will try to reserve food for them. This will be computed as follows:
- Maximum of 10 food per colonist
- Maximum of power percentage per colonist (maybe distorted by an exponential factor?)
- Most powerful colonist reserves first
This means:
- As long as there is 10 food per colonist stored, nobody is going to starve
- Colonists with 0 power will be cut off from food immediately when supplies get low
- A colonist with high relative power will not starve for a long time
- Assume 60 food and 6 colonists, 1 colonist has 50 power, 5 colonists have 10 power each
	-> 60 food left, 10 for 1 colonist, 50 for 5 colonists, all eat 2
  -> 48 food left, 10 for 1 colonist, 38 food for 5 colonists, all eat 2
  -> 36 food left, 10 for 1 colonist, 26 food for 5 colonists, all eat 2
  -> 24 food left, 10 for 1 colonist, 14 food for 5 colonists, all eat 2
  -> 12 food left, 6 for 1 colonist, 6 food for 5 colonists, one eats 2, others eat 1
  -> 5 food left, 2.5 for 1 colonist, 2.5 food for 5 colonists, one eats 2, others eat 0
  -> 3 food left, 1.5 for 1 colonist, 1.5 food for 5 colonists, one eats 1, others eat 0
  -> 2 food left, 1 for 1 colonist, 1 food for 5 colonists, one eats 1, others eat 0
  -> 1 food left, 0.5 for 1 colonist, 0.5 food for 5 colonists, one eats 0, others eat 0
  -> The powerful colonist has lacked 4 food, while the others lacked 9 food each
- Assume 30 food and 3 colonists, 1 colonist has 90 power and 2 colonists have 5 each
  -> 10 food per colonist, all eat 2
  -> 24 food left, 10 for 1 colonist, 14 for 2 colonists, all eat 2
  -> 18 food left, 10 for 1 colonist, 8 for 2 colonists, all eat 2
  -> 12 food left, 10 for 1 colonist, 2 for 2 colonists, one eats 2, 2 eat 1
  -> 8 food left, 7 for 1 colonist, 1 for 2 colonists, one eats 2, 2 eat 0
  -> 6 food left, 5 for 1 colonist, 1 for 2 colonists, one eats 2, 2 eat 0
  -> 4 food left, 3 for 1 colonist, 1 for 2 colonists, one eats 2, 2 eat 0
  -> 2 food left, 1 for 1 colonist, 1 for 2 colonists, one eats 1, 2 eat 0
  -> 1 food left, 0.5 for 1 colonist, 0.5 for 2 colonists, all eat 0
  -> The powerful colonist has lacked 3 food, while the others have lacked 11 food
