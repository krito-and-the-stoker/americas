## Production
Good production in fields is categorised into
- main production
- secondary production
- possible production
These help to build a mental model of the otherwise complicated and hard to learn rules of yields. Main production is what will always yield most and will scale best on a field with buildings and experts. Secondary production will scale somewhat, but never yield very good results. Possible production enables you to produce a tiny bit of a good, that otherwise may be hard to have access.
