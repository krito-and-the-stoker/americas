Literacy
- Settlers have a literacy level (0% - 100%)
- Teachers at schools, collages and universities increase literacy for everyone in the colony
- literacy levels provides production bonus for in-colony jobs
- to become an expert at a job, a certain literacy level is required (literacy cap)

Buildings:
School: 1 teacher, teaching field professions
Collage: 1 teacher, teaching manufacturing professions
University: 1 teacher, teaching higher education professions
Although they theoretically are levels of an education building, a collage should not replace a school and a university should replace neither, instead a second level school makes the school bigger allowing for more teachers

Baracks: 1 teacher, teaching soldiers
Library: Increase literacy, faster promotion when high literacy

Promotion:
Promotion without being educated in school is only possible between certain jobs:
settler -> farmer, fur hunter, tobacco planter, cotton planter, sugar planter, fisher, ore miner, lumberjack, hardened pioneer
fur hunter -> fur maker
tobacco planter -> tobacconist
cotton planter -> weaver
sugar planter -> rum destiller
expert fisher -> master trader
ore miner -> blacksmith
blacksmith -> gunsmith
lumberjack -> carpenter
Some professions cannot be reached without education:
statesman, priest, missionary, soldier

With external education it is possible to (education means: a colonist of this profession is currently a teacher)
- any can become an expert at the current job from any profession

When a colonist, who already has a profession, learns a new profession, he keeps his old profession as a promotion progress of 100%.

When a colonist is working a job, he very slowly loses promotion progress for all other jobs
