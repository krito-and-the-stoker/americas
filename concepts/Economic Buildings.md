#new-world #colonies #buildings

These buildings enhance productivity and efficiency. Inside the colony, they create workspace and increase capacity for workers. They can be divided into two categories:
- Outside of the colony infrastructure
- Inside the colony infrastructure

## Outside

TODO: Find better names for most of these buildings (all levels): The names currently focus on something that would better be built on a field instead. We want to tell the story of a better infrastructure for a certain good, so the names should instead reflect the immediate steps before or after harvest, i.e transport, durability etc.
