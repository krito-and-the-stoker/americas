#colonies #new-world #buildings 
New buildings:
- trade post (small, big)
   - you can set one (ore more) goods you need, which will trigger nearby settlements to send a trader with that good. negotiations are made in a popup and may result in a trade route. natives will want resources from that colony, they don't care for money
   - more levels can support more trade routes
- harbour, trade port
   - like trade post, but for other European ships, that will appear.
   - level 1 import, level 2 also export

- dock, loading bay, commercial harbour
   - influences the time of loading/unloading of ships
   - without a dock, the ships crew manages loading without infrastructure. this will be slow and only 1 ship at a time
   - a dock without worker provides 1 extra loading space (2x for 1 ship)
   - a dock provides 1 space and one job for a worker (5x for 1 ship)
   - loading bay provides 3 jobs (10x per ship, 1 ship per worker)
   - commercial harbour provides 3 jobs (25x per ship, 2 ship per worker)

- post office, logistic office, warehouse center
   - for automating internal trade
   - level 1 import, level 2 also export, level 3 also balance
   - level 3 has statistics about goods movement
