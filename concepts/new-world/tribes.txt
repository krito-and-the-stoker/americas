	slowly lose satisfaction from
	 -> close terraforming (-3 - 3)
	 -> big colonies (-3 - 4)
	 -> fortifications (-3 - 2)
	 -> settlements with significantly worse relations
	 -> restricted movement in their home territory
	slowly gain satisfaction from
	 -> trade (-2 - 5)
	 -> missions (-3 - 5)
	 -> raids and fights (-4)
	 -> settlements with significantly better relations

	when satisfaction is too big/too small, an emissary is sent into the closest colony
	giving the chance to save the relation level

	Relations work on a per settlement level, but when relations with one settlement has reached a state of war, this settlement may call in all fighters of its tribe, essentially creating a war with the whole tribe.
