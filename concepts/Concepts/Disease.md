Diseases are a new concept. Colonists in the new world can become ill, which is reflected in there [[Colonist States]]. When fallen ill, they will try to acquire the [[Virtual Goods]] health care, which increases their survival chance. After some time, chance decides if they will recover or die. Once recovered, they develop some resistance and the chance to become ill is reduced permanently.

Some more thoughts on that:
- Settlers can fall ill: severe production malus
- When fallen ill, after some time a settler will either die or recover
	- The living standard of the settler influences the chance of recovery - After recovery, the settler is more immune to the diseases
- Health benefits for:
	- housing
	- doctors / hospitals
	- Power value
- high population density increase chance of desease
- work type has effect on desease
- Terrain dependent: More hot or wet areas are more prone to deseases
- Chance of getting ill depends on the heritage and region:
	- Natives often fall ill when in contact with Europeans
	- Northern Europeans have trouble with hot weather (Carribean, Mexico, Florida)
	- Africans have trouble with cold weather (Canada)
