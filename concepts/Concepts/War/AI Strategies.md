AI Strategies

## Economic attacks:
### Surprise Raid:
Natives may choose this interaction to start a war to drive out the colonizers. Uses the element of surprise.
Triggered by:
- native settlement when dropping from hostile to war
- natives have not much fighting experience against Europeans
- Europeans are not highly militarized

### Coordinated untargeted raid:
Raid as many (barely) undefended targets as possible, potentially in a sneak attack.
Triggered by:
- natives in war or dropping towards war
- Europeans well defended

### Single untargeted raid:
Raid a single undefended colony to gain goods
Triggered by:
- settlement with less than friendly relations
- small pirate base
- colony undefended
- high value goods in colony

### Targeted Raid (Colony raid):
Raid a specific target, which may include overcoming its defenses. This tactic can be employed by well equipped natives, pirates or other European powers.
Triggered by:
- settlement hostile or worse
- big pirate base
- colony not fortified
- high value goods in colony

### Trade Raid:
The AI will try to predict where trade ships or wagons will pass to raid those routes. This tactic will be most likely be employed at sea by pirates and at land by natives.
Triggered by:
- pirate base
- settlement hostile or worse
- many ships / wagontrains move around
