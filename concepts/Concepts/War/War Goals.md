## Timeline of hostilities:
Sometimes, but not always, wars are preceded by hostilities, raids or other incidents.
A war formally breaks out once it has been declared by either party. Potential war goals are:
- Retaliation for previous attack (against natives, by natives)
- Pacify rebellion (against natives)
- Independence (against the king)
Other war goals, for example conquering other colonies are controlled by the king.

The AI has a value called war enthusiasm. Once the enthusiasm is exhausted from fighting (especially when losing), it will seek peace at increasingly bad terms.

### Peace treaties by war goal:
- Retaliation:
	Win: Enemy loses all shared territory, natives give up additional territory and agree to remove settlements
	Loss: Lose all shared territory, give up additional territory and agree to disband offending colonies
- Pacify rebellion
  Win: Status quo, extra slaves and extra taxes
  Loss: ??
- Independence
  Win: Win the game
  Loss: Lose the game


### These war goals facilitate two types of gameplay
#### Retaliation
The player will settle in shared territory, clear forest in natives hunting grounds, ultimately upset the natives by grabbing too much land. The natives will make an attempt to stop that with warnings, leading into an attack. This attack gives the chance for a retaliation war, that changes the borders and forces the loser to remove their settlements. That way, the player can repeatedly push back natives and claim their whole territoy, while never fighting an offensive war.
#### Pacify rebellion
The player can send a conquistador and declare a native tribe to be a subject of the motherland. This will allow him to extract taxes and slaves from the natives. If the natives are unhappy with this, they will rebel. The player can then send an army to pacify the rebellion and force the natives to pay taxes and slaves.
