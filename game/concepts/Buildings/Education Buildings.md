Educational buildings help improve [[Literacy]] and increase the speed of [[Promotion]]. High Literacy leads to faster promotion, while schools, collages and universities allow to speed up promotion directly with teachers. Also note, that some promotions cannot be acquired without a teacher, such as the elder statesman.
## School
### Jobs
1 teacher:
- Teaching his profession and increasing literacy
- Requires a low class [[Professions]] or none
## Collage
### Jobs
1 teacher
- Teaching his profession and increasing literacy
- Requires a medium class [[Professions]]
## University
### Jobs
1 teacher
- Teaching his profession and increasing literacy
- Requires a high class [[Professions]]

Although they theoretically are levels of an education building, a collage should not replace a school and a university should replace neither, instead a second level school makes the school bigger allowing for more teachers, etc


## Library
### Effect
Slowly increases literacy for every colonist in the colony
