A few more thoughts on the details of this concept are necessary.
### Overview
- Settlers have a literacy level (0% - 100%)
- Teachers at schools, collages and universities increase literacy for everyone/some (?) in the colony
- Literacy levels provides production bonus for some jobs (maybe)
- To become an expert at some job, a certain literacy level is required, called literacy cap

### The idea
Literacy is used to describe the long term effort of bringing education to the whole of society. A well educated society is able to promote much more quickly, and some professions will not be achievable for lower class colonists without education.
#### Literacy cap
There will be no literacy cap for low class jobs, and the literacy cap for middle class jobs must be mild enough so that most free colonists will pass, but for example criminals and other especially uneducated will need to be educated first. Upper class jobs will have a literacy cap that is initially prohibitive for the average colonist, but with some education should also be possible
#### Promotion speed
We want to use literacy to greatly enhance promotion speed. In the early stages of the game, literacy will not be great. If the player builds [[Education Buildings]], this can be changed slowly over time, giving good access to experts (see [[Professions]]) in the long run.

Literacy can be increased by [[Education Buildings]].
