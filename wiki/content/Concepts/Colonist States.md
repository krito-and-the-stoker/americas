#colonies #new-world #colonists #states

These states influence the colonist and modify his behaviour and stats. Multiple states can be active at the same time. 
### Bonus (doing well)
when available to the colonist, he will use some resources
- +1 production bonus
- immigration attraction
- power boost
### Promoting
When possible, the colonist is learning the profession he is working at
- uses the resources he would use if he had already mastered the profession
the speed of promotion depends on:
- having a teacher with the profession in school/college/university
- the literacy rate
- having an expert of his profession as coworker
### No luxury (goods missing except food and wood)
- temporarily lose his profession bonus for production and teaching
- immigration penalty for this profession
### No wood
- production malus
- production bonus for wood
- increased chance of illness
- **events**:
	- Tear down building (results in partially restocking the wood and a lost building)
	- Tries to become lumberjack
### Starving
- production malus, except for food
- increased chance of illness
- **events**:
	- Raid food from natives:
		may get food, upset natives, higher chance with guns
	- Steal food from stock:
		only when stock is high and multiple colonists suffer, will destroy some food
	- Leave colony to join natives:
		only when relations with natives are good, may come back after some time
	- Leave colony for Europe:
		higher chance with international trading port, more likely for high power colonists
	- Die from starvation:
		more likely for low power colonists
### Sick
- production penalty
- power penalty
- **events**:
	- dies
	- gets healthy (will make him more resistant in the future)
### Discriminated
- cannot promote
- power penalty
### Enslaved
- cannot promote
- no cultural assimilation
- can only work on land
- power is always 0
- health penalty
- small production bonus
- needs 2 food
- **events**:
	- escape
	- rebellion
	- freedom
### Indebted
- cannot promote
- power is always 0
- needs 2 food
- wears off after a few years (debt payed)
- **events**
	- escape and live with the natives
### Poor
- when a colonists power falls to 0, he becomes poor
- power cannot get lower than 0
- needs 2 food
- cannot have state *bonus*
- cannot have state *no luxury* (keeps expertise without receiving the goods!)
- once the colonists power reaches 10, he will lose the poor state
### Very powerful (idea, maybe not?)
Once a colonist reaches very high power (maybe 100 or more), he becomes powerful and may resist a few of your actions:
- they only accept to take a job, if it is their profession or higher than their current class
- they refuse to take a gun, unless their profession is soldier
- Can vote on laws or independence declaration
