These buildings are almost all late game buildings, and each of the creates some kind of automation:

The earliest kind of automation will probably be good transport automation:
- The **post office**, which allows to automate *import/export* for automated transportation.
- The **overseas harbour** automates *ships to Europe* to sell/buy.

Now that with the overseas harbour you do not oversee the ships going to Europe, you will most likely want:
- The **immigration office** automates bringing immigrants from Europe on otherwise empty ships.

A streamlined expansion system for new colonies:
- The **frontier planning office** enables *automated pioneers* and will gift a *post office* to new colonies
- The **labour agency** allows you to assign *jobs to future people* in a colony, that will be sent into the colony automatically.
- The **travel agency** allows you to automate *go to colony* commands, by allowing land units to use assigned ships.

With all these automations in place, the focus of the game scales up tremendously.

### Logistic
1. Post office: Automatic import/export
2. Logistic office: Automatic balance
- Needs ships or land transports assigned
### Overseas harbour
- Can dedicate goods for export to Europe
- Can order specific amount of goods from Europe
- Needs ships assigned
- has import/export statistics
### Immigration office
- information and statistics about immigration progress
- ships that would otherwise sail empty from Europe
will instead take immigrants to the immigration center
- extra ships can be assigned, but do not have to
- can make systematic choice who immigrates first
### Colony planning office
- Allows to create a default construction queue
### Frontier planning office
- assign pioneers for automation
- allows central scheduling of pioneering work (plow field, build road etc)
- allows to order build road from here to there
- when building a new colony, it will start with a post office
### Labour agency
- all unemployed in this colony will wait for an assignment from the workforce office
- once assigned, they will move to the destination and start with their assignment
- the workforce office allows you to assign work in a remote colony (if they are connected)
- after a while of unemployment, colonists from other colonies will automatically come here
- employment statistics
### Travel agency
- assign ships
- the travel agency creates ship routes between colonies that are unreachable or very far otherwise
- increases the range for automated units by supporting their travel
