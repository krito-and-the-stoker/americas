### Some Ideas about buildings
Currently, we can only have one building of a kind. With the new city layout, it becomes very reasonable to have multiple chapels, carpenters etc. At the same time, it sounds reasonable to stop the manufacturing output for a building when being under construction for upgrade. For example, when a tobacconists house is being upgraded to a shop, all tobacconists in that house would stop producing cigars. Instead, they help with the construction process. Once the upgrade is finished, the tobacconists produce cigars again. With that mechanic, the player must be given a way to select which building to upgrade when there are multiple of the same kind.

This idea gives an implicit cost of update to the player. For example I remember building a very costly cigar factory, although I was not sure if I really need it but I didn't know what else to do with my carpenters. This kind of unengaged behaviour would stop with this change, because now, while upgrading, I am not producing cigars anymore, which I do care about more than the new building. This idea also creates a bigger anticipation for the finishing of upgrade construction works, as all the input goods amass and a temporary shortage of the output goods arises, just to be caught up on once the upgraded building is there.
