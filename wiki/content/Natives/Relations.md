### Slowly lose satisfaction from
- close terraforming (-3 - 3)
- big colonies (-3 - 4)
- fortifications (-3 - 2)
- settlements with significantly worse relations
- restricted movement in their home territory
### Slowly gain satisfaction from
- trade (-2 - 5)
- missions (-3 - 5)
- raids and fights (-4)
- settlements with significantly better relations

when satisfaction is too big/too small, an emissary is sent into the closest colony
giving the chance to save the relation level

Relations work on a per settlement level, but when relations with one settlement has reached a state of war, this settlement may call in all fighters of its tribe, essentially creating a war with the whole tribe.
