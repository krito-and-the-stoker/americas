These are the physical goods. We also have [[Virtual Goods]]
## Current goods
- Food: Basic need, every colonist and most units require 2 food per [[Production Cycle]]
- Sugar: Cash crop, can be made into rum
- Tobacco: Cash crop, can be made into cigars
- Cotton: Cash crop, can be made into cloths
- Furs: Cash crop, can be made into coats
- Wood: Construction good, all buildings need it, also every colonist needs 1 wood per [[Production Cycle]]
- Ore: Raw good that can be made into tools
- Silver: Very high priced good in Europe
- Horses: Needs redo, currently only used by scouts and dragoons
- Rum: Expensive trade and luxury good
- Cigars: Expensive trade and luxury good
- Cloths: Expensive trade and luxury good, needed by ships
- Coats: Expensive trade and luxury good
- Trade Goods: Needs a bit rethinking, is in the game but pretty much unused
- Tools: Very useful, important for construction and pioneering
- Guns: Used by colonists in a colony to defend themselves, equip soldiers

## Potential new goods:
- rename trade goods -> beads (good idea)
- stone (for high prestige buildings, church, fortress) (good idea)
- coffee (cash crop) (good idea, introduce later with an event)
- livestock (could be an alternative food source) (good idea, more thoughts needed)
- tea, porcelain (import only goods) (why not)
- sulfur (tools + sulfur -> guns) (not high priority for me)
- dye (made from trees in Brazil) (probably not necessary)
- salt (for meat and fish conservation, probably not necessary)

## Idea
We want to tell the story, that tools, guns and horses (or animals in general) make a huge technological difference for the settlers. early settlements rely on their availablility and often fail when they run out of stock.
- tools will increase the efficiency of farming, mining, fishing, woodcutting
- guns will increase the efficiency of hunting
- horses/livestock will increase the efficiency of farming, mining, hunting and woodcutting
- guns will arm the colonies militia, giving a significant edge in fights against natives
The usage of tools, guns and horses in normal production should not be high, but constant. They will remind the dependency on the motherland and the home market before an industry for tools and guns has been built in the new world. Once, a colony is out of these goods, the production bonuses they yield will vanish, hurting the economy severely.

At this point it is not clear how we would make this into a concrete concept.

### Some historical idea about our goods

#### Furs
Were not available in great numbers and considered a luxury item, often used for hat-making. While they would be worth more than tobacco or sugar, they are significantly harder to produce in numbers, and were mostly acquired by trade with natives and trapping. As a fashion item, furs prices would fluctuate more than other goods.
#### Sugar
Is very labor intensive to harvest. On top, quite expensive infrastructure like sugar mills are needed to produce. On top of that, when it gets too cold, the harvest is ruined. By 1700 sugar is part of the European diet and has a huge demand in Europe.
#### Tobacco
Tobacco is a bit easier to harvest compared to sugar and does not need as much processing. It is very addictive and has high demand in Europe, although prices are a bit lower than sugar. Can be sold in bulk.
#### Cotton
Is not so much in high demand before the cotton gin is invented in 1793. This kicks of the textile production revolution and greatly increases demand quickly.
#### Silver
Would be about as 10x more valuable than tobacco.
#### Rum
The prices for rum in Europe were not overwhelming due to the available competition of brandy, gin, whiskey, etc. Can be sold at bulk at stable prices.
A misconception told by the old Colonization I is, that rum is not produced from sugar, but from a relatively worthless byproduct, therefore not consuming any sugar, but highly linked to sugar production.
#### Coats
Where  made from furs and cloths and used by colonists, especially in the colder regions in the north. The processing of furs into coats needs a skilled coat maker, otherwise furs may be ruined. Additionally, it could be risky to manufacture furs into coats from afar and not hitting the current fashion in Europe.
#### Cigars
Cigars are a luxury item, that differentiate the enthusiast from the commoner. It needs skilled experts to select the right leaves and cannot be as easily sold as a bulk good like tobacco. Prices would be plummeting if the market is flooded by cigars, because it would lose its status as a luxury item.
#### Cloths
While not so easy to produce, these are quite essential for every day use and are needed in the colonies, and can be sold in bulk in Europe.

#### Compared to ship
A shipment of tobacco could be about as valuable as the whole ship, if not more.

## Prices
### Highest Value

- **Silver**: As a precious metal, it has the highest value per freight ton.
- **Tea**: Highly prized, especially as demand in Europe grew.
- **Cigars**: Luxury tobacco product, high value per unit.
- **Guns**: Essential for defense, hunting, and trade, with a high value especially when of superior quality.

### High Value

- **Coffee**: Like tea, coffee became a highly valued commodity in Europe.
- **Furs**: High-quality furs were in demand for luxury clothing and accessories.
- **Coats**: Finished garments made from quality materials, including furs, would have a significant value, though less efficiently packed.

### Moderate Value

- **Cloths** (regular): Essential for clothing and household goods, widely traded but less valuable per unit than luxury textiles.- **Sugar**: A key commodity in the colonial trade, with substantial demand.
- **Rum**: Popular alcoholic beverage, with value added through distillation.
- **Sugar**: Worth more than tobacco but harder to produce.
- **Tobacco**: A major cash crop, valuable for its wide consumption, though less than processed cigars.
- **Tools**: Essential for construction, agriculture, and daily life, representing significant value.

### Lower Value

- **Cotton**: Pre-industrialization, its value was less due to the labor-intensive process of cleaning and preparation.
- **Iron Ore**: Essential for making iron and steel, but bulkier and of lower value per ton than precious metals.
- **Wood**: Crucial for construction and as fuel, but its value per ton is lower due to its abundance and bulk.
- **Stone**: Similar to wood, essential for construction but widely available and bulky.

### Lowest Value

- **Horses**: While individually valuable, their need for space, care, and the inefficiency in transportation lowers their value per freight ton.
- **Livestock**: Essential for agriculture and food, but like horses, the space and care requirements reduce value per freight ton.
- **Regular Food**: Staple necessity, but perishable and low value per ton.
